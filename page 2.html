                <li>"A lot of changes have happened since some of these negative reviews, so definitely give it a chance! It feels like Stardew Valleyish, but with the goal of starting and running your restaurant. I am really loving it!" - Player Nimirin</li>
                <li>"Game is a lot of fun would definitely recommend. Only negative is sometimes quest items can be a grind to get." - Player liamtattersall76</li>
